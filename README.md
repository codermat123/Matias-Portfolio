## Python

### Fintech Foundations and applications Upenn
**Background**:  
Inspired by a Fintech course I completed, my goal was to develop a user-friendly course program that summarizes the key learning points.

The program features 4 specializations with 80+ segments of readable course material.
Users can navigate using a main panel through Specializations-Topics-Segments with back functions and user-friendly visuals.

### Expense Budgetting Tracker Sandbox
This Projects features tracking / budgetting of expenses in different categories. 

**Key Features**:  
View / Edit current expenses in separate CSV file. 
Set budgets, view remaining budget and average daily expense. 

### Calculator and Currency Converter
Entry-level projects to explore finance-related tasks.

Currency converter uses API to fetch currencies rates.

## Python Jupyter Notebook: Machine learning

### Google Prediction LSTM, SP500 randomforestclassifier, Tesla Linear Regression 
**Background**:  
I explored different Machine Learning algorithms to predict stock prices with the help of Youtube, github, stack overflow and coding communities.

**Key Features**:
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, yfinance libraries
- Data analysis, visualization, cleaning
- Testing and training of ML model

## HTML, CSS
### Powerpoint of website in Fin-dex folder
For my CS50 assigment, I developed Fin-Dex, an interactive blog website that explores the ABCDS of Fintech (AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Big Data). 

This website features a home, about and contact page with a read more button that redirects the user to respective blogs.
## PowerBI
This project marks my first time employing Data visualization and analysis tools on raw data extracted from data.gov.sg.

- Using PowerBI, I formed relationships and statistics between crimes and genders
- Debunking of "Do male's commit more crimes stigma" using statsitcs
